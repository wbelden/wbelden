My name is Wade Belden. 
I am currently completing an A.A.S. degree in Software Development, and I have a certificate in Data Analytics from Butler Community College.

I have knowledge in Swift, C++, Java, and Python.
I would describe myself as a self starter and quick learner.
My approach to problem solving is to understand the source and then find an unbiased answer.
